Risk-like game prototype. It has barely been tested, and there is no
visualizer yet. This document may itself be buggy and incomplete. Enjoy!

The example-game script doesn't seem to like relative paths on my system, so
you will probably have to put the absolute path in.

Bot inputs:

loadtime n
turntime n
player_id n
width n
height n
turns n
player_seed n	# all n are ints
neutral_id n	# ID given to neutral territories, currently 10000
t id group x y owner armies	# territory id group x y owner armies
				# note that group currently does nothing, but
				# the idea is that it will be used to group
				# territories for bonus armies.
				# x and y are just for the unwritten visualizer
				# and should be removed eventually.
c id1 id2	# connect territory id1 to territory id2
p id armies	# player, id, armies to be placed

# Everything above except for the first field are integers
# Everything below has two single-letter fields, and one or two integer fields

Bot orders:

o d num target	#deploy num troops to target (sources and targets by id)
o a num source target # attack-only with num troops from source to target
o t num source target # transfer-only with num troops from source to target
o m num source target # move num troops from source to target, whether by
                      # attack or transfer
