Tron artificial intelligence programming game.

This is still being developed and tested. It's playable, but 
don't be surprised if there are bugs and revisions along the way.

Currently there is a basic (mostly untested) Python starter package.

If you discover a bug, write a starter package or improve something, please
post about it on the forum, on IRC or on Github:

== I/O format ==
================

Server to Bot:


Game setup:

turn n
loadtime n
turntime n
player_id n
cols n
rows n
turns n
player_seed n

All of the above 'n' values are integers.

Formatted communication lines:

a r c h o		:	agent row col heading owner
w r c			:	wall row col

'r' and 'c' and 'o' are integers
'h' is one of the four letters 'n', 'e', 's' and 'w' for the 
    four cardinal directions
'w' is a wall, though it is referred to throughout the code as water.
    The wall lines are only sent at the start of the game; bots can track
    subsequent blocked tiles from agent locations.

During game:

a r c h o		:	agent row col heading owner
d r c o			:	dead row col owner

Players can see all walls and other agents, and they may have any 
integer for a player ID.

Bot to server:

o r c h			:	order row col heading

This orders the agent at row, col to proceed in the direction specified 
by heading. Having been set upon a course, you don't need to continue 
issuing orders to maintain it; the agent will proceed until told to change 
direction again.

Map file format:

Map generators needed!

rows n
cols n
players n
agents_per_player n

a r c h o		:	agent row col heading owner

m .%			:	map land water

Example map file:

#
# tron_01.map
#
cols 10
rows 10
players 2
agents_per_player 1

a 2 2 s 0
a 7 7 n 1
